Big O: describes the rate of increase in time/space

Sharing a file with a friend

max size of a file can be 5TBs

now there are two approaches via,
1. Electronic medium
2. Personally hand it over 

approach #2, takes constant time 5 hours(say),
			here whatever the file size is, it takes only 5hrs
			
where as approach #1 depends on the file size,
		 here lets assume time is linearly dependant on file size 
		 
Time complexity
approach #1:  O(n), n-> file size 
approach #2:  O(1)


Does O(1) means that it is always better than O(n)?
NOOO...
For some inputs O(n) is faster than O(1), like in the above example
if file size is in MBs, than it would take a min or two to share, which 
is much much better than 5 hours of journey.

This cleary states that, Big O notation tells the rate of increase in time/space 
for an algorithm as the size of input increases.
